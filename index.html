                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br>
                    honestly feel I got every penny's worth. </h2>
                    <p>was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. Ive been looking to make a <br>
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br>
the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>
weeks was the best- and most grueling time Of my life. Since completing the course, l've <br>
successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

                experience. Highly <br>
                recommended!</h4>
                <p>Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br>
                   never written a line of code.I needed <br>
                   some structure from professionals <br>
                   who can help me learn programming <br>
                   step by step. I was encouraged to <br>
                   enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
                   who can only say wonderful things <br>
                   about the program. The entire <br>
                   curriculum and staff did not <br>
                   disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
                   and I never had to wait long for <br>
                   assistance. The agile team project, in <br>
                   particular, was outstanding. It took <br>
                   my learning to the next level in a way <br>
                   that no tutorial could ever have. Infact, I've often referred to it during <br>
                   interviews as an example of my <br>
                   developent experience. It certainly <br>
                   helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
                   developer after receiving multiple <br>
                   offers. 100% recommend!</p>
